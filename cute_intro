Developing CUDA Kernels for Accelerated Matrix Multiplication on NVIDIA Hopper Architecture using the CUTLASS Library

With reference to the functionality exposed by CUTLASS, performance is sensitive to many parameters such as:

决定 cuda 矩阵乘法的因素包含以下
  Shape of matrices (tall, skinny, or square);
• Layout of matrices (row or column);
• Number of warps per thread block;
• Thread block shape;
• Thread cluster shape;
• Number of pipeline stages in the software pipelining optimization;
• Chosen precision (TF32 vs FP32 vs FP16 vs FP8);
• Usage of special MMA instructions like WGMMA or TMA.
